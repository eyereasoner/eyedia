## The question

In 1936 Alan Turing described an imaginary machine: a long tape of cells, a
head that reads and writes one cell at a time and moves left or right, and
a small table of instructions. Anything a modern computer can calculate,
such a machine can calculate too.

Here the machine adds one to a **binary** number (written with only 0 and 1).

**What is 101001 + 1?** And can we watch every move of the machine?

## What we tell Eyedia: the machine

```prolog
start(add1, 0).
t([0, 0, 0, r], 0).
t([0, 1, 1, r], 0).
t([0, #, #, l], 1).
t([1, 0, 1, s], halt).
t([1, 1, 0, l], 1).
t([1, #, 1, s], halt).
```

Each line reads: *in state S, seeing symbol X, write Y, move (l)eft,
(r)ight or (s)tay, and go to the next state.* `#` is a blank cell.

State 0 runs right to the end of the number. State 1 walks back, turning
1s into 0s until it can turn a 0 (or a blank) into a 1: the carry.

---

## What we tell Eyedia: the interpreter

```prolog
find(State, Left, Cell, Right, OutTape) :-
    t([State, Cell, Write, Move], Next),
    move(Move, Left, Write, Right, A, B, C),
    continue(Next, A, B, C, OutTape).

continue(halt, Left, Cell, Right, OutTape) :- reverse(Left, R), append(R, [Cell|Right], OutTape).
continue(State, Left, Cell, Right, OutTape) :- State \= halt, find(State, Left, Cell, Right, OutTape).
```

An **interpreter** is a program that runs another program. This one looks
up the instruction, moves the head, and repeats until the state is `halt`.

---

## What Eyedia concludes

```prolog
compute([1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, #]).
compute([1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, #]).
compute([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, #]).
compute([], [1, #]).
```

In everyday numbers: 41 + 1 = 42, 47 + 1 = 48, 63 + 1 = 64 (the number
grows a digit), and an empty tape becomes 1. The trailing `#` is the blank
cell the head stopped next to.

---

## Why: the proof in plain words

For 101001, the proof records every move:

1. Start in state 0, reading the first 1. Rule `t([0, 1, 1, r], 0)`:
   keep the 1, move right.
2. Read 0: keep it, move right. … and so on to the blank at the end.
3. At the blank, switch to state 1 and step left.
4. Read 1: write 0, step left (the carry).
5. Read 0: write 1, halt.

Each move names the instruction it used and the tape before and after.

## Checked, not just claimed

The checker went through all four runs: 144 steps.

- 142 were matched to the exact instruction or program line they cite;
- the 2 built-in tests ("state 0 is not `halt`", "state 1 is not `halt`")
  were **recomputed** by the checker itself;
- no step depends on itself in a circle, and nothing is extra.

Verdict: **checked**. All 144 steps verified, nothing taken on trust.

## Try it

```sh
node bin/eyedia.js examples/turing.pl
node bin/eyedia.js --proof examples/turing.pl
```

Or open it in the [playground](https://eyereasoner.github.io/eyedia/playground/#example=turing).
Add `true :+ compute([1, 0, 1, 1], _).` and run again: you get
`compute([1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0, #]).`, that is 11 + 1 = 12.

## Takeaway

A Turing machine is computation at its barest. With a proof, every tick of
it becomes something you can read, replay and check.
