# Witnesses

*When a rule creates something new, give it a name that says where it came from.*

## The question

Suppose a rule says: *every person has a record*. For Alice and Bob, that
means two new records exist. But what are they called? And how do we keep
the record and its owner tied together?

A name for something a rule brings into existence is called a *witness*:
it stands as evidence that the thing exists.

**Can we make each witness say exactly which rule made it, and for whom —
and conclude two facts about it at once?**

---

## What we tell Eyedia

Two people, and one rule with two conclusions:

```prolog
person(alice).
person(bob).
(has_record(Name, record(person_rule, Name)), record_owner(record(person_rule, Name), Name)) :+ person(Name).
```

The witness is the term `record(person_rule, Name)`: a record labelled with
the rule's name and the person it was made for.

The left side holds *two* conclusions in brackets. Both share that same
witness, so they always talk about the same record.

---

## What Eyedia concludes

```prolog
has_record(alice, record(person_rule, alice)).
record_owner(record(person_rule, alice), alice).
has_record(bob, record(person_rule, bob)).
record_owner(record(person_rule, bob), bob).
```

Two facts per person. Alice's record is `record(person_rule, alice)` —
readable, stable from run to run, and impossible to mix up with Bob's.

---

## Why not let Eyedia invent names?

Eyedia can invent placeholder names for things a rule leaves unnamed. But an
explicit witness is better when you want one per rule and per binding:

- it says *which* rule made it and *for whom*;
- running the program again gives the same names, so results compare
  cleanly;
- firing the rule twice for Alice still gives one record, not two.

---

## Why: the proof in plain words

1. Alice is a person — *a fact we gave (fact 1)*.
2. So Alice has the record `record(person_rule, alice)` — *rule 3, with
   Name = alice*.
3. And that record's owner is Alice — *rule 3 again, same binding*.

Bob's two facts follow the same way from fact 2. Both conclusions cite the
same rule and the same value for `Name`: that is how a shared multi-part
conclusion shows up in the proof.

---

## Checked, not just claimed

A separate checker read all 6 steps against the program and confirmed that:

- each step is an exact instance of the line it cites (6 of 6);
- no step depends on itself in a circle;
- every one of the 4 conclusions is justified, and nothing extra is
  included.

Verdict: **checked**. Nothing taken on trust.

## Try it

```sh
node bin/eyedia.js examples/witnesses.pl            # the four facts
node bin/eyedia.js --proof examples/witnesses.pl    # with their proof
```

Or open it in the [playground](https://eyereasoner.github.io/eyedia/playground/#example=witnesses).

Add `person(carol).` and run again: two more facts appear, with the
witness `record(person_rule, carol)`.

---

## Takeaway

A good name carries its own history. By building the witness from the rule
and the binding, every new thing Eyedia concludes can be traced to where it
came from — even before you look at the proof.
