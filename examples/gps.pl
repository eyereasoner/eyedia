% Goal driven Parallel Sequences -- Jos De Roo

% Find sequences of actions that lead from the current state to a goal state
% within limits on duration, cost, belief, comfort and the number of stages (a
% stage is a run of steps in the same map). Each description is a transition
% from a state fluent to a new one, with the action that makes it and what that
% action costs; belief and comfort multiply along a path, duration and cost add.
%
% The original keeps the current state in the database: it reads transitions
% with clause/2, proves their preconditions as goals, and asserts and retracts
% fluents as it moves. Here the state is a list of fluents passed along the
% search, and a transition replaces its From fluent by its To fluent.
